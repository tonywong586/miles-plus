Welcome to the **MILES+** project repository! 🚀 This initiative, developed by **Group 1 HEXUS**, aims to revolutionize the Asia Miles experience, transforming it into a more dynamic and engaging daily currency. Here, you'll find everything you need to understand the project setup, development, and deployment.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The **MILES+** project addresses key challenges in the Asia Miles loyalty program, such as the underutilization of miles and limited user engagement. By offering innovative solutions, **MILES+** aims to make Asia Miles more versatile and integrated into daily routines, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.

### 🔍 Identified Challenges
1. **Unused Miles**: A significant portion of Asia Miles remains inactive due to limited engagement opportunities.
2. **Low User Engagement**: Users often find it difficult to interact regularly with the loyalty program due to a lack of daily utility and diverse redemption options.

### 🎯 Project Goal
Our mission is to **elevate user engagement** with Asia Miles by:
- Integrating it seamlessly into everyday activities.
- Expanding the scope of earning and redemption opportunities.
